# Set Office 2016 Click to Run Channel with PowerShell
#
# PowerShell sets the registry key for the appropriate update channel and kicks off the update process
# You can move back channels as you please
# Note if a GPO is set it might overide this
# Note, changing build/channel might cause issues, do it at your own risk
