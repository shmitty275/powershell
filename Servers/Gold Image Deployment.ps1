# This Script is a deployment script, it will first copy a pre-prepared VHDX, and create a new VM with it based on the settings below. Then the script deploys Active
# Directory to then VM and then provisions a new forest. Once complete, another new VM is created in the same manner and it is provisioned as a file server and a new
# Share is created. 

# Assumptions
# Your Hyper-V host is running Windows Server 2016 TP5, Windows 10 or newer
# Your Target Guest OS is running Windows Server 2016 TP5, Windows 10 or newer
# You have a pre-created "Golden Image" VHDX that has been syspreped with the /generalize /oobe and /mode:VM switches.
# You have created an answer file using the Windows SIM (System Image Manager) which is part of the Windows 10 ADK 
# https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit#winADK 
# You have placed your answer file inside of the VHDX by mounting it in Windows 10 and then placing the unattend.xml file in the path
# C:\Windows\Panther

# First we set some targeting variables for the Host environment
# The $vSwitch Variable is the Name of the vSwitch you'd like the new VMs to use for network connectivity
# $VHDXPath is the root path of your VHDX storage
